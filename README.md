# Project Proposal
This is a brief about my dataset and why I chose to work on it. 

# Data Introduction
The source I took the dataset from was Kaggle, the dataset contains Predicting Depression, Anxiety, and Stress related data.
Data was collected as survey from 2017-2019 to anyone using online-version of Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS). There were 40,000 participants in this 42-question survey and was answered on a 4 point scale to indicate how often the question was applicable to the person in the past week. Other surveys were also given to the participants to gather background data on their personality and demographics.

# Objective of Project
To get enriching information about the DASS (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales) to find better relationships between variables and make better sense of the results. In short, we'll make a solid model that will predict depression before it happens.

# Data Defining
Defining DASS Scores
DASS: Depression Anxiety Stress Scales The DASS-42 is a 42 item self-report scale designed to measure the emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress, The essential function of the DASS is to assess the severity of the core symptoms of Depression, Anxiety and Stress.
High scores on the DASS would certainly alert the clinician to a high level of distress in the patient and this would need to be explored further within the interview process.

Each of the 42 questions is scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (“Did not apply to me at all”) to 3 (“Applied to me very much, or most of the time”). Scores for Depression, Anxiety and Stress are calculated by summing the scores for the relevant items:

Depression: 3, 5, 10, 13, 16, 17, 21, 24, 26, 31, 34, 37, 38, 42

Anxiety: 2, 4, 7, 9, 15, 19, 20, 23, 25, 28, 30, 36, 40, 41

Stress: 1, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 18, 22, 27, 29, 32, 33, 35, 39

# Demographics Defining
Generic Demographics Survey was also given to participants Example of questions include:
"How much education have you completed?"
"What is your gender?"
"How many years old are you?"

# My Questions To The Dataset
Is depress linked to a specific gender?

Does someone's race have to do with him for being depressed?

When someone's education level goes a level higher, does that affect to the possibility of falling a victim to depression?

Does marriage reduce the chances of being depressed?

# A heavy work will be done regarding cleaning the data
